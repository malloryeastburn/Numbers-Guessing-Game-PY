# Numbers-Guessing-Game-PY
 This project will receive the number range from the user, generate a random number within that range, and allow the user to guess the number until they exceed the minimun number of guesses.

This project was found on: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/number-guessing-game-in-python/

This is my first project in 100 Days of Code.

My goal is to begin using github again regularly and complete the 100 Days of Code challenge.
